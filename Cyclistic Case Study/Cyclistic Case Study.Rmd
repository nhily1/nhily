## Load Packages and Import Data

This is an R Markdown document of the Cyclistic Case Study. First, we will load the necessary packages.

```{r load packages, warning=FALSE}
library(readr) # read in csv files
library(tidyverse) # wrangle data
library(lubridate) # date functions
library(ggplot2) # visualizations
library(scales) # visualization, change x and y axis scales
```

Next, set up our working directory and import all the data sets.

```{r import data}
getwd() # get current working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Whitney/Desktop/Raw Data - Cyclistic Bike") # set working directory

# import data
june2020 <- read.csv("202006-tripdata.csv")
july2020 <- read.csv("202007-tripdata.csv")
august2020 <- read.csv("202008-tripdata.csv")
september2020 <- read.csv("202009-tripdata.csv")
october2020 <- read.csv("202010-tripdata.csv")
november2020 <- read.csv("202011-tripdata.csv")
december2020 <- read.csv("202012-tripdata.csv")
january2021 <- read.csv("202101-tripdata.csv")
february2021 <- read.csv("202102-tripdata.csv")
march2021 <- read.csv("202103-tripdata.csv")
april2021 <- read.csv("202104-tripdata.csv")
may2021 <- read.csv("202105-tripdata.csv")
```

### Clean and Process Data

We want to combine all the data sets into one large data set, but we first have to check to see if the data types of each columns match.

```{r}
# str(june2020)
# str(july2020)
# str(august2020)
# str(september2020)
# str(october2020)
# str(november2020)
# str(december2020)
# str(january2021)
# str(february2021)
# str(march2021)
# str(april2021)
# str(may2021)
```

Checking the data types of each datasets shows that **start_station_id** and **end_station_id** changes from an integer to a character type on December 2020. Since we want to keep any character values in December and onward, we will change the **start_station_id** and **end_station_id** columns in June 2020-November2020 from an integer to a character type.

```{r change data types and combine datasets}
june2020 <- mutate(june2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

july2020 <- mutate(july2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

august2020 <- mutate(august2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

september2020 <- mutate(september2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

october2020 <- mutate(october2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

november2020 <- mutate(november2020, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                   end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))

# combine datasets
bike_data <- bind_rows(june2020, july2020, august2020, september2020, october2020, november2020, december2020,
                       january2021, february2021, march2021, april2021, may2021)

```

Drop columns that are not needed for analysis.

```{r drop start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng}
bike_data <- bike_data %>%
              select(-c("start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng"))
```

The column **member_casual** should only have 2 distinct values (member and casual), so let's check to see if this is true.

```{r}
unique(bike_data$member_casual)
```

Extract day, month, year, and day of the week from **started_at** column and place them into new columns.

```{r date}
bike_data$date <- as.Date(bike_data$started_at) # get date from started_at column

bike_data$month <- format(as.Date(bike_data$date), "%m") # get month
bike_data$day <- format(as.Date(bike_data$date), "%d") # get day
bike_data$year <- format(as.Date(bike_data$date), "%Y") # get year
bike_data$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(bike_data$date), "%A") # get day of the week
```

Calculate bike ride length and place it in a new column called **ride_length**. Values in this new columns are in seconds.

```{r trip duration}
bike_data$ride_length <- difftime(bike_data$ended_at, bike_data$started_at) # calculate trip duration
```

We need **ride_length** to be a numeric type for our analysis, so check to see if it is a numeric type. If not, change it to be.
```{r change ride_length data type to numeric}
is.numeric(bike_data$ride_length) # check to see if ride_length is numeric
bike_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(bike_data$ride_length)) # change it to numeric type
is.numeric(bike_data$ride_length)
```

We will remove any observations where the bikes were taken from HQ for a quality check and any observations with a negative **ride_length**. Put this in a new data frame.

```{r remove unnecessary observations}
bike_data_v2 <- bike_data[!(bike_data$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | bike_data$ride_length < 0) ,]
```



### Analysis

Get a summary of **ride_length**.
```{r mean, median, max, and min of ride_length}
summary(bike_data_v2$ride_length)
```


Determine if there is a difference between trip duration of members and casual riders.

```{r aggregate}
aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```

Now, see if there is a difference between users on each day of the week.

```{r}
aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual + bike_data_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# order weekdays starting on Sunday
bike_data_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(bike_data_v2$day_of_week, 
                                    levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
                                             "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

The days are out of order, so let's reorder days of the week to start on Sunday.

```{r find number of rides and average ride length by user type}
bike_data_v2 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% # use wday() function to get day of the week
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarize(num_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%  # calculates number of rides and average ride length
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) # sort by users and day of the week
```



### Visuals
Create a bar graph of number of rides by user type on each day of the week.

```{r number of rides by each day of the week}
bike_data_v2 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarize(num_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = num_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by User Type Each Day of the Week", x = "Day of the Week", y = "Number of Rides") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "User Type") + # rename legend title
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) # change y-axis values from scientific notation to full numbers
```

Create a bar plot of average bike ride duration by user type on each day of the week.

```{r average duration by each day of week}
bike_data_v2 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarize(num_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(title = "Average Duration of Bike Rides by User Type Each Day of the Week", 
       x = "Day of the Week", 
       y = "Bike   Ride Duration (seconds)") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "User Type") # rename legend title
```



### Create a csv file of the analysis

Create a data frame of the analysis summary.

```{r create a dataframe of analysis named counts}
counts <- aggregate(bike_data_v2$ride_length ~ bike_data_v2$member_casual + bike_data_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

# save it as a csv file
write.csv(counts, file = "C:/Users/Whitney/Desktop/avg_ride_length.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```




### Additional Analysis

```{r find out how many members and casual riders there are each month}
bike_data$month <- format(as.Date(bike_data$date), "%b") # abbreviated month format

# update bike_data_v2
bike_data_v2 <- bike_data[!(bike_data$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | bike_data$ride_length < 0) ,]

# order months to start on Jun
bike_data_v2$month <- ordered(bike_data_v2$month, levels = c("Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"))

# summary
bike_data_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarize(num_of_rides = n()) %>%  
  arrange(member_casual, month) # sort by users and month

# line graph
bike_data_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarize(num_of_rides = n()) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, month) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = num_of_rides, group = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) + 
  geom_line(size = 0.8) + # line width
  labs(title = "Amount of Cyclistic Members and Casual Riders", 
       subtitle = "June 2020 to May 2021", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Number of Rides") + 
  scale_color_manual(name = "User Type", # rename legend title
                     values = c("casual" = "seagreen", "member" = "purple")) + # add colors to lines
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) # change y-axis values from scientific notation to full numbers

# create data frame of number of users by month
monthly_users <- bike_data_v2 %>%
                  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
                  summarize(num_of_rides = n()) %>%  
                  arrange(month, member_casual) # sort by month first, then users

# save it as a csv file
write.csv(monthly_users, file = "C:/Users/Whitney/Desktop/monthly_users.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
